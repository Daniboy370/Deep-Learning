# Deep-Learning

Using tensorflow's open-source library for [object detection](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md) I implemented two models :

- **Single Shot Detector ([SSD](https://github.com/Daniboy370/Deep-Learning/blob/master/Side-Projects/SSD_object_detection/img_object_detection.ipynb))** (classification and localization) :

- **Mask R-CNN inception resnet v2** (Instance segmentation) :

- **DeepLab_v3 implmentation** (Instance segmentation) :
